## Introduction

In this project, I set up a mini honeynet in Azure and configured it to send log data from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace. This data was then utilized by Microsoft Sentinel to generate attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. To evaluate the security of the environment, I first measured key security metrics over a 24-hour period with minimal security controls. After implementing enhanced security measures to harden the environment, I measured the same metrics for another 24 hours. Below, I present the results of these measurements. The metrics included are:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

## Architecture Before Hardening / Security Controls

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were initially deployed and exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls fully open, and all other resources were accessible via public endpoints, with no Private Endpoints in use.

For the "AFTER" metrics, I enhanced security by hardening the Network Security Groups to block all traffic except from my admin workstation. Additionally, all other resources were secured using their built-in firewalls and Private Endpoints.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics I measured in my insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2024-06-12 11:46:22 AM
Stop Time 2024-06-13 11:46:22 AM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 20980
| Syslog                   |9556
| SecurityAlert            | 3
| SecurityIncident         | 355
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 1427

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries returned no results, indicating no instances of malicious activity were detected during the 24-hour period following the hardening of the environment.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics I measured in my environment for another 24 hours, but after I have applied security controls:
Start Time 2024-06-14 2:49:27 PM
Stop Time	2024-06-15 2:49:27 PM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8454
| Syslog                   | 1
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, I set up a mini honeynet in Microsoft Azure and integrated log sources into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was employed to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Initially, I measured metrics in the unsecured environment before applying security controls. After implementing these controls, I measured the metrics again. The results demonstrated a substantial reduction in security events and incidents, highlighting the effectiveness of the security measures.

Itâ€™s important to note that if the network resources had been heavily utilized by regular users, more security events and alerts might have been generated during the 24-hour period after the security controls were applied.
